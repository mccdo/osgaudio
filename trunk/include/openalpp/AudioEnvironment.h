    * - And then the calculations in InverseDistance... This is equivalent to the
    * <a href="http://www.iasig.org>IASIG</a> I3DL2 distance model.\n
    *
    * In the above calculations, the variables have the following meanings:\n
    * - dist is the distance from the listener to the source.\n
    * - REFERENCE_DISTANCE are the distance at which the listener will experience
    * GAIN. Both are set per source.\n
    * - ROLLOFF is a source specific factor of attenuation. If it's set to one,
    *   the InverseDistance model will describe a "physically correct" inverse
    *   square behaviour.\n
    * - MIN_GAIN, MAX_GAIN and MAX_DISTANCE are values used for clamping gain
    *   and distance, respectively.
