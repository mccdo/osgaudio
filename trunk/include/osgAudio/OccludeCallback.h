    OccludeCallback is executed from a SoundUpdateCB during the update traversal (or the depracted
    SoundNode during cull).
    By analyzing if the line-of-sight is free by shooting a ray from the listener towards the position
    specified in the apply() call, 
    a damping factor is applied to the gain of the soundstate for the current sound node.

    Currently only one ray is shot from the center of the listener to the center of the soundsource, instead
    of one per ear.

    The operator() method is executed both when the source is occluded as well as it is not.
    operator() implements the actual occlusion functionality.

    The default one, interpolates the damping over a short timeperiod trying to avoid clicks...
