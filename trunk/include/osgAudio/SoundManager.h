    /// A SoundManager handles the sound system.
    /*!
    This class initialises the Sound system. It also keeps track of loaded sound samples.
    It is based on the Singleton Design pattern.
    To manage a limited resource of Sound sources (which is usually around 32)
    a schema has to be set up.

    This class initially initializes sound sources and places them into a pool of available sources.
    Whenever someone calls allocateSource() the SoundManager tries to free a source
    and return a pointer to it. If there are no sources available it goes through the 
    active sources and tries to find one with a lower priority. If it still fails, an exception is
    thrown.
    Otherwise the found source is returned.

    The allocateSource() has an argument indicating if the source should be placed in the
    list of active sources. If this argument is false, the caller is responsible to
    call releaseSource() when finished using the source.

    SoundManager also handles SoundStates.
    Whenever pushSoundEvent() is called, a FlyWeight set of SoundStates is checked for a free SoundState.
    The argument of pushSoundEvent() is copied to the free SoundState and that SoundState
    is then pushed to the queue of waiting SoundStates.

    When SoundManager::update() is called, the queue of waiting SoundStates is checked and for each
    SoundState a Source is allocated.
    When the SoundManager realizes that a SoundState is not playing anymore, it is removed from
    the list of active SoundStates and put back in to the FlyWeight set of available SoundStates.

    This makes the pushSoundEvent method suitable for playing soundeffects.
