        The Camera's view matrix is used to position the Listener.
        SoundRoot::update() queries the camera during update to
        obtain the view and update the Listener position.
        If camera is NULL, SoundRoot sets the Listener position to 0,0,0.

        If you have multiple views, specify the Camera for the view you'd
        like to use to represent the Listener's audio experience.

        If you want to specify the Listener position explicitly from your
        application, then there is no need to set a Camera here. However, you
        will need to explicitly set the Listener position after the update
        traversal and before any cull traversals, like so:
