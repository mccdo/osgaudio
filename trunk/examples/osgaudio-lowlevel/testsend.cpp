 * Example where a soundfile is loaded using alutLoadWav and streamed over a
 * UDP socket to a receiver that will read the datastream and play it.
 *
 * Note about selecting rate, format and sending rate:
 * Rate is given in samples per second, and format gives the size of one
 * sample. This means that, for example:
 *  If the format is Mono16, we have one channel with 16 bit per channel, i.e.
 *   16 bit or 2 bytes per sample.
 *  Say we have a frequency of 44100 samples per second. 2 byte samples will
 *   mean that we need to stream 88200 bytes per second. 
 *  If we can send (and receive) ten packets per second, each packet should be
 *   at least 8820 bytes.
 *  If we instead had a frequency of 11025, then it would be enough with 2205
 *   bytes per packet.
 * Of course it's a good idea to add a few hundred bytes to those numbers ;)
