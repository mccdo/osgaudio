		Issues with streamed audio. (Sounds created with with System::createStream
		or FMOD_CREATESTREAM). When changing the loop count, sounds created with
		System::createStream or FMOD_CREATESTREAM may already have been pre-buffered
		and executed their loop logic ahead of time, before this call was even made.
		This is dependant on the size of the sound versus the size of the stream decode
		buffer. See FMOD_CREATESOUNDEXINFO.
		If this happens, you may need to reflush the stream buffer. To do this, you can
		call Channel::setPosition which forces a reflush of the stream buffer.
		Note this will usually only happen if you have sounds or looppoints that are
		smaller than the stream decode buffer size. Otherwise you will not normally
		encounter any problems.
